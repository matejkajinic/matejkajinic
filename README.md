# Matej Kajinic

I'm a research-driven engineer, investor, and founder with broad range of interests. I'm an optimist and I believe almost everything is achievable with technology.
I also believe there are two currencies of today: **FLOPS (intelligence)** and **Watts (energy)**.

I have an M.S. in Computer Science, where I researched using neural networks to forecast financial market trends. I also have a B.S. in Electrical Engineering & Communication Technologies, focused on electromagnetic waves and real-world propagation models.

## Highlights

* **Venture capital** - sourced early startups (e.g., Cursor, Perplexity) with >15x theoretical returns in 18 months, led tech DD on 20+ deals (e.g., Groq, MavenAGI)

* **Public markets** - over 10 years of investing outperforming benchmark by 46.9 percentage points

* **Founder** - built and led early forms of spatial intelligence, creating predictive "world models" from geospatial data to solve physical challenges

* **Operator** - led Mountain Rescue Service unit for 6 years, participated in some of the most complex cave rescue operations in the world

## Research and writing

I study real world and physical limits of tech progress.

* **Energy Is All You Need** (Internal Paper, June 2024) - thesis why we need more nuclear and solar energy to power AI's growth, guiding infrastructure investments

* **The Economics of Intelligence** (Internal Paper, March 2024) - detailed research of chip supply chain, bottlenecks, and predicts GPU needs in near and mid-term future

* **Application of Neural Networks for Forecasting Financial Market Trends** (Master's Thesis, July 2021) - built neural nets for predicting market shifts

* **[Educational Simulation Tools for Radio Wave Propagation Models](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333340116_Educational_Simulation_Tools_for_Radio_Wave_Propagation_Models)** (Publication, April 2019)

## Selected technical projects

* **[PhotoRewind](https://photorewind.com/)** - AI tool to fix old, damaged photos with machine learning. Built with Elixir, Phoenix; runs on Raspberry Pi 5.

* **[AI for Historical Document Analysis](https://github.com/matejkajinic/3A-D20)** - system to read and analyze handwritten docs from Dubrovnik archives from 13th century (Python, Tesseract OCR, OpenCV, Pandas)

* **[Drone Swarm Simulation](https://github.com/matejkajinic/ros-flocking)** - simulates group drone flights with ROS (C++, ROS, Gazebo, Python)

* **[Google Coding Challenge](https://github.com/matejkajinic/google-code-challenge)** - participating in Google Coding Challenge (Python)

* **[VC Liquidation Preference Simulator](https://github.com/matejkajinic/vcliquidation)** - web app to model VC payouts for founders and investors (JavaScript, Vite, Recharts)

* **[GPU Memory Comparison](https://github.com/matejkajinic/gpu-memory-comparison)** - visualization of different types of GPU memory (JavaScript, React, Recharts)
